# employee-management-system-python
This repository is written to create robust employee management system in Python console.

Project Description: 
The purpose of the software requirements document is to systematically capture requirements for the project and the “Employee Management System” to be developed. Both functional and non-functional requirements are captured in this document. It also serves as the input for project scoping.  
The scope of this document is limited to addressing the requirements from a user, quality, and non-functional perspective.  
Project Objective: 
A new system is required to automate creation and maintenance of employee  and department records  
Scope: 
 Employee information creation and maintenance  Department creation and maintenance  Mapping each employee to the respective department 
  
Functional Requirement: 
 Create a CRUD application for Employee and Department table (Utilize SQL module of python)  Read from and write data to a text file ,whenever a new record is added to the department / employee table, an entry has to go to the text file (incorporate what you have learnt related to file handling in python)  Make use of Exception handling to make it robust  Wherever possible make use of multi-processing / multi-threading   Try to make it modular (remember re-usability of the code)
